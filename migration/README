 Comments regarding G2 json formatting ...
   - whitespace is not important
   - block property in connection is the id of the block at the other end
   - id properties are expected to be UUIDs. 
   - options for connection type: ANY,DATA,TEXT,TRUTHVALUE,SIGNAL
   - options for direction: INCOMING, OUTGOING

   We are using a "lenient" parser that allows non-quoted property names. 
   Strictly speaking all properties should be quoted.
