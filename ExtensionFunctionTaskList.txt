Extension Functions

BLOCKS
1) There are already get/set auxiliary data functions as part of block interface, but have not been extended to Python.
   Extend them.
2) Add methods onSave and onDelete to block interface and extend to Python.
3) There is already a setName() method on a block. No need for a rename(). Extend to Python.
4) Modify FinalDiagnosis.py to call previous get/setAux, save, delete python modules directly.
5) Convert all code in BLT that calls block extension srcipts, to simply call methods on blocks.

NODES in NavTree (Applications, Families, Diagrams)
1) Create UDT with subtags: save, delete, rename, setAux, getAux. These are all Strings containing python module paths. Argument lists are assumed.
2) Create UDT instances in Configuration/DiagnosticToolkit for both production and isolation for: Application, Family, Diagram.
3) Go through BLT and replace all references to SQLite "Toolkit" entries with these tag references to obtain script names.
4) Convert extension manager to look at tag values instead of SQLite.
