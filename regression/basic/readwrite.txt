Test: Reading and Writing Tags
Step: Boolean tag reader
Show: browser "app75/family75/readwrite"
Tagset: SingleBoolean
10:00 true
10:00:20 Assert: ReadWriteBooleanOutput = True "Output is true"
10:01 false
10:01:20 Assert: ReadWriteBooleanOutput = False "Output is false"
10:02 true
10:03 true
10:03:20 Assert: ReadWriteBooleanOutput = True "Output is true"

Step: Numeric tag reader
Tagset: DualInput
10:04  1
10:04:20 Assert: ReadWriteNumericOutput = 1 "Output is 1"
10:05  2
10:06  3
10:06:20 Assert: ReadWriteNumericOutput = 3 "Output is 3"
10:07  4
10:08  5
10:08:20 Assert: ReadWriteNumericOutput = 5 "Output is 5"


Step: Dual Inputs

10:10:20 Assert: ReadWriteNumericOutput = 3 "Output is 3"
10:10  4 2
10:10:20 Assert: ReadWriteNumericOutput = 4 "Output is 4"

Step: Numeric source to sink
Tagset: ReadWriteSource

10:11 98
10:12:20 Assert: ReadWriteSink = 98 "Sink is 98"
10:13 97
10:14 96
10:15:10 Assert: Parameter = 96 "Parameter is 96"
10:16 95
